      <description>Fred Hebert&amp;rsquo;s latest book Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang and Elixir is out in a print version from The Pragmatic Programmers.
If you are like me you&amp;rsquo;ve known you need to figure out property testing for a long time now and keep putting it off. Now that there is a book, with a free version even, it is the best time to get going.
The book even details avoiding a common pitfall that I certainly fall into anytime I&amp;rsquo;ve tried picking up property based testing: attempting to shoehorn property testing in to any problem even when a regular unit test is a better fit.</description>
