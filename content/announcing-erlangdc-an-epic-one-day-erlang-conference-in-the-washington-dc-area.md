We are happy to announce [ErlangDC](http://erlangdc.com/): An Epic One-Day Erlang Conference in the Washington, DC area.  
  
New to Erlang? Learn the basics — and find out why Erlang should be in your programmer's toolkit — during the morning bootcamp. Meet fellow DC-area Erlang enthusiasts at lunch. Learn advanced Erlang techniques in the afternoon tech talks. Swap Erlang war stories and make lifelong friends over pints at the post- conference Happy Hour.  
  
It will be reliably awesome. Just like Erlang.  
  
ErlangDC is organized by the local DC Erlang Meetup Group, with help from Erlang Solutions and Erlang Factory. The event will be hosted at the AOL Headquarters in Dulles, VA.  
  
[Sign up](http://erlangdc.com/) when you get a chance. The early-bird tickets have been sold out fast! Tickets are only $40.
