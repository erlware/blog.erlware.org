Erlware has been moving very slowly for the last 2 years while [Eric](http://twitter.com/cyberlync) and [Martin](http://twitter.com/martinjlogan) have been off writing the recently published [Erlang and OTP in Action](http://manning.com/logan). We are back to our passion, we have two new core team members, [Jordan Wilberding](http://diginux.net) and [Tristan Sloughter](http://github.com/tsloughter), and we are working hard on Erlware!
