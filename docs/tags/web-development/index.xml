      <description>TL;DR
As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, Opa is a new web framework that introduces not only the framework itself but a whole new language. A lot has changed in Opa since I last posted about it. Now Opa has a Javascript-esque look and runs on Node.js. But it still has the amazing typing system that makes Opa a joy to code in.
The currently available Heroku buildpack for Opa only supported the old, pre-Node, support.</description>

      <description>Why Cowboy and Batman.js There are a lot of Erlang web frameworks out there today. Not all are modeled after the MVC model (see Nitrogen), but I think all of them are addressing the problem the wrong way. I recently gave a presentation, slides hereÂ and the code for this example here, describing my perferred method for using Erlang for web development and why I think it is the best way to go.</description>
