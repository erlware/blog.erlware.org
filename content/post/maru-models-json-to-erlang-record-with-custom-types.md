+++

Working with Erlang for writing RESTful interfaces JSON is the communication "language" of choice. For simplifying the process of JSON to a model the backend could work with efficiently I've created _maru_models_. This app decodes the JSON with _jiffy_ and uses functions generated by a modified version of Ulf's _exprecs_ to create an Erlang record. The generated functions are created with type information from the record definition and when a property is set for the record through these functions it is first passed to the _convert_ function of _maru_model_types_ to do any necessary processing.   
  
I separated this application into a separate repo to simplify people trying the examples. But the real development will be done in the Maru main repo.
