      <title>Major OpaDo Speed-Up with @publish</title>

      <description>I received a patch for OpaDo from Francois Regis Sinot that has made the hosted OpaDo http://opado.org on Dotcloud MUCH faster, adding and removing item is now instantaneous. He placed @publish around explicitly server side functions that caused adding todo items to go from 21 to 1 server calls. I thought this simple but maybe not obvious for new Opa developers (it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t to me!) needed a blog post so that beginners like my self may find it and be able to start using the @publish directive.</description>

      <description>This is a continuation of two past posts (one, two) on my first application with Opa called OpaDo. You can try the live demo here and check out the full source code on Github
Updating OpaDo to add user accounts the project structure has been changed a bit and modularized. Below is the new project layout.
Now there is a main, todo and user module. The main module is the entry point for the app and looks like:</description>

      <description>OpaDo (a port of the TodoMVC app to Opa) now persists todo items to the Opa database. The new version is up on dotcloud, http://opado-tristan.sloughter.dotcloud.com/
I&amp;rsquo;ve added a todo_item type which stores the item&amp;rsquo;s value and two other attributes we won&amp;rsquo;t use until the next post when we have user accounts for their own todo_item stores.
To tell Opa where to store the records we&amp;rsquo;ll create, we provide a path to the Opa db function and set its type.</description>
